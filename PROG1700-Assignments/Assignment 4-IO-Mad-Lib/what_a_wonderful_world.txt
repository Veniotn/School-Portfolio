1) I SEE TREES OF GREEN, RED ROSES TOO
2) I SEE THEM BLOOM FOR ME AND YOU
3) And I think to myself what a wonderful world!
4) I see skies of blue and clouds of white
5) The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
6) And I think to myself what a wonderful world!
7) The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
8) Are also on the faces of people going by
9) I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do

11) I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
12) They'll learn much more than I'll never know
13) And I think to myself what a wonderful world!
14) Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world!
